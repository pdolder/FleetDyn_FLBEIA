abstract = {Achieving single species maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (mixed fisheries) is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. The North Sea mixed fisheries are a representative example of an issue that is generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of “pretty good yield”, implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range, minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks captured within mixed fisheries, and addressing explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks.},

FLR: an open-source framework for the evaluation and development of management strategies. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 640-646. The FLR framework (Fisheries Library for R) is a development effort directed towards the evaluation of fisheries management strategies. The overall goal is to develop a common framework to facilitate collaboration within and across disciplines (e.g. biological, ecological, statistical, mathematical, economic, and social) and, in particular, to ensure that new modelling methods and software are more easily validated and evaluated, as well as becoming widely available once developed. Specifically, the framework details how to implement and link a variety of fishery, biological, and economic software packages so that alternative management strategies and procedures can be evaluated for their robustness to uncertainty before implementation. The design of the framework, including the adoption of object-orientated programming, its feasibility to be extended to new processes, and its application to new management approaches (e.g. ecosystem affects of fishing), is discussed. The importance of open source for promoting transparency and allowing technology transfer between disciplines and researchers is stressed.},

abstract = {Advice for commercially exploited fish stocks is usually given on a stock-by-stock basis. In light of the ecosystem-based fisheries management, the need to move towards a holistic approach has been largely acknowledged. In addition, the discard bans in some countries requires consistent catch advice among stocks to mitigate choke species limiting fisheries activity. In this context, in 2015, the European Commission proposed the use of fishing mortality ranges around fishing mortality targets to give flexibility to the catch advice system and improve the use of fishing opportunities in mixed-fisheries. We present a multi-stock harvest control rule (HCR) that uses single stock assessment results and fishing mortality ranges to generate a consistent catch advice among stocks. We tested the performance of the HCR in two different case studies. An artificial case study with three stocks exploited simultaneously by a single fleet and the demersal mixed-fishery operating in Bay of Biscay and Celtic Sea. The HCR produced consistent catch advice among stocks when there was only a single fleet exploiting them. Even more, the HCR removed the impact of the discard ban. However, in a multi-fleet framework the performance of the HCR varied depending on the characteristics of the fleets.},

abstract = {Fishery systems are complex systems that need to be managed in order to ensure a sustainable and efficient exploitation of marine resources. Traditionally, fisheries management has relied on biological models. However, in recent years the focus on mathematical models which incorporate economic and social aspects has increased. Here, we present FLBEIA, a flexible software to conduct bio-economic evaluation of fisheries management strategies. The model is multi-stock, multi-fleet, stochastic and seasonal. The fishery system is described as a sum of processes, which are internally assembled in a predetermined way. There are several functions available to describe the dynamic of each process and new functions can be added to satisfy specific requirements.},
