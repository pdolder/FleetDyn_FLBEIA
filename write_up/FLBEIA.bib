abstract = {Advice for commercially exploited fish stocks is usually given on a stock-by-stock basis. In light of the ecosystem-based fisheries management, the need to move towards a holistic approach has been largely acknowledged. In addition, the discard bans in some countries requires consistent catch advice among stocks to mitigate choke species limiting fisheries activity. In this context, in 2015, the European Commission proposed the use of fishing mortality ranges around fishing mortality targets to give flexibility to the catch advice system and improve the use of fishing opportunities in mixed-fisheries. We present a multi-stock harvest control rule (HCR) that uses single stock assessment results and fishing mortality ranges to generate a consistent catch advice among stocks. We tested the performance of the HCR in two different case studies. An artificial case study with three stocks exploited simultaneously by a single fleet and the demersal mixed-fishery operating in Bay of Biscay and Celtic Sea. The HCR produced consistent catch advice among stocks when there was only a single fleet exploiting them. Even more, the HCR removed the impact of the discard ban. However, in a multi-fleet framework the performance of the HCR varied depending on the characteristics of the fleets.},

abstract = {The Northern Prawn Fishery harvests a variety of prawn species including some short-lived species with highly variable recruitment such as banana prawns and slightly longer-lived tiger prawns with less variable recruitment. An evaluation of stock assessment methods and management strategies for the Northern Prawn Fishery using the management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach requires an (operating) model of the resource to act as the 'truth' for the analyses. A five-stock, two tiger prawn species operating model with a weekly time-step is developed and conditioned using more than 30 years of logbook catch and effort data as well as the results of fishery-independent research. The operating model is projected beyond the present using stock-specific stock-recruitment relationships. Banana prawns are not modelled explicitly, but their impact on the management system is simulated empirically. The input control nature of the management system is mimicked using an effort allocation model that allocates effort by species, area and week. This model allows for the impact of changes over time in efficiency, a key uncertainty in the assessment of these species, and the impact of management implementation error, which has historically been substantial. Some of the properties of the operating model are illustrated by projections based on a constant effort policy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To understand how data resolution impacts inference on mixed fisheries interactions we developed a highly resolved spatiotemporal discrete-event simulation model MixFishSim incorporating: i) delay-difference population dynamics, ii) population movement using Gaussian Random Fields to simulate patchy, heterogeneously distributed and moving fish populations, and iii) fishery dynamics for multiple fleet characteristics based on population targeting under an explore-exploit strategy. We applied MixFishSim to infer community structure when using data generated from: commercial catch, a fixed-site sampling survey design and the true (simulated) underlying populations. In doing so we thereby establish the potential limitations of fishery-dependent data in providing a robust characterisation of spatiotemporal distributions. Different spatial patterns were evident and the effectiveness of a simulated spatial closure was reduced when data were aggregated across larger spatial areas. The simulated area closure showed that aggregation across time periods has less of a negative impact on the closure success than aggregation over space. While not as effective as when based on the true population, closures based on high catch rates observed in commercial data were still able to reduce fishing on a protected species. Our framework allows users to explore the assumptions in modelling observational data and evaluate the underlying dynamics of such approaches at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. From our application we conclude that commercial data, while containing bias, provides a useful tool for managing catches in mixed fisheries if applied at the correct spatiotemporal scale.},

Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to define 8 clusters with relatively homogenous species compositions. These clusters formed 34 distinct spatial regions in the waters around Ireland. Identification of these regions can be useful for a number applications, including spatial stratification of commercial or survey data, defining and characterising fishing grounds for marine spatial planning, evaluation of closed areas and prediction of how fishing effort might be re-allocated following a closure. A case-study is presented that explores options to reduce cod (Gadus morhua) catches by implementing seasonal closures in two of the 34 regions. Cod are caught by demersal trawlers in a mixed fishery and the catches often exceed the quota, resulting in discarding of marketable fish. Two regions were identified that had relatively low effort and high cod landings. The effects of closing these regions during the first quarter of the year were explored. Cod catches were likely to be reduced by 8-22% while only 3-9% of the annual demersal otter trawl effort would be displaced. Whiting catches were also likely to be reduced, the change in catches of some other species depended on the assumed effort displacement. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many flatfish species are caught in mixed demersal trawl fisheries and managed by Total Allowable Catch (TAC). Despite decades of fisheries management, several major stocks are severely depleted. Using the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) as an example, the failure of mixed-fisheries management is analysed by focussing on: the management system; the role of science; the role of managers and politicians; the response of fisheries to management. Failure of the CFP management could be ascribed to: incorrect management advice owing to bias in stock assessments; the tendency of politicians to set the TAC well above the recommended level; and non-compliance of the fisheries with the management regulations. We conclude that TAC management, although apparently successful in some single-species fisheries, inevitably leads to unsustainable exploitation of stocks caught in mixed demersal fisheries as it promotes discarding of over-quota catch and misreporting of catches, thereby corrupting the basis of the scientific advice and increasing the risk of stock collapse. This failure in mixed demersal fisheries has resulted in the loss of credibility of both scientists and managers, and has undermined the support of fishermen for management regulations. An approach is developed to convert the TAC system into a system that controls the total allowable effort (TAE). The approach takes account of the differences in catch efficiency between fleets as well as seasonal changes in the distribution of the target species and can also be applied in the recovery plans for rebuilding specific components of the demersal fish community, such as plaice, cod and hake. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a 'best' management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current 'best practice' guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

abstract = {Single-species management is a cause of discarding in mixed fisheries, because individual management objectives may not be consist- ent with each other and the species are caught simultaneously in relatively unselective fishing operations. As such, the total allowable catch (TAC) of one species may be exhausted before the TAC of another, leading to catches of valuable fish that cannot be landed legally. This important issue is, however, usually not quantified and not accounted for in traditional management advice. A simple approach using traditional catch and effort information was developed, estimating catch potentials for distinct fleets (groups of vessels) and me ´tiers (type of activity), and hence quantifying the risks of over- and underquota utilization for the various stocks. This method, named Fcube (Fleet and Fisheries Forecast), was applied successfully to international demersal fisheries in the North Sea and shaped into the advice framework. The substantial overquota catches of North Sea cod likely under the current fisheries regimes are quantified, and it is estimated that the single-species management targets for North Sea cod cannot be achieved unless substantial reductions in TACs of all other stocks and corresponding effort reductions are applied.},

Assessing these technical interactions is of great importance for fishery management, as any control applied to one fishing unit may have positive or negative effects on others. The magnitude and direction of these effects cannot be easily measured, unless all fishing units and species in the fishery are considered simultaneously. Technical interactions are particularly important in the complex artisanal fisheries of the English Channel. Using a bioeconomic model of the English Channel that incorporates all the major fishing units (the BECHAMEL model), we describe a method for measuring and classifying the technical interactions due to the competition for resource (stock externalities). The results are used to develop a typology of m{\'{e}}tiers and fleets based on their overall level of interaction for the resource.

abstract = {Existing fisheries models employ the "unit stock" concept that makes no explicit allowance for spatial distribution of biomass and effort over a fishing ground. The utility of the unit stock concept rests largely upon the "dynamic pool" assumption. However, this is both invalid for sedentary species, and difficult to apply when information on spatial distribution by statistical subunits is available, as for the Georges Bank (lat. 42°N, long. 67°W) scallop population. By reference to the Georges Bank scallop fishery, more realistic general assumptions for a spatial model of shellfish populations are:a) Recruitment occurs in patches of random size and location with the constraint that local biomass does not exceed the virgin biomass of each unit area.b) The fraction of effort expended within each statistical area of a fishing ground is either determined by available local biomass alone (proportional effort allocation) or in combination with "traditional fishing practice."Therefore, a spatial model (YRAREA) simulating nonrandom recruitment and harvesting of sedentary organisms is postulated and applied to Georges Bank scallop stocks. Some of the general predictions of this model differ significantly from those employing the unit stock concept, as follows:1) Under proportional effort allocation, overall yield declines more sharply with increasing effort subsequent to maximum sustained yield (MSY) than under dynamic pool assumptions. 2) Peak mortality and the apparent point of full recruitment on the catch curve occur progressively earlier in life (even at partially recruited ages) with increased effort or degree of clumping of the population, and subsequently declines with age, except where "fully recruited" ages coincide spatially with the "target" age-group making up the largest biomass component. This may be of general relevance to fisheries under intensive exploitation with sophisticated methods of navigation and fish finding; peak mortality may occur earlier in life than predicted from the gear selection ogive, if year-classes are independently distributed and there is no size limit regulation. 3) Variance in biomass/unit area is predicted to fall with age.For the Georges Bank scallop population, the model described herein predicts that a substantial increase in yield would result from diversion of effort from the Northern Edge to less heavily fished areas of the bank.},

abstract = {Efficiency of mixed-fisheries management and operational implementation of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management rely on the ability to understand and describe the technical and biological interactions between fleets, gears and species. The present study aims to describe fine-scale spatial patterns of the French demersal mixed fisheries in the Celtic Sea and discusses their implications in terms of management. Analysis was made by integrating vessel monitoring systems and logbook data collected between 2010 and 2012 at a 3'*3' spatial scale through the use of principal component analysis followed by hierarchical clustering. It revealed spatial regions defined by a distinct homogeneous composition of retained catches. Each cluster was also described in terms of the fishing activity: vessel length, effort, power and gear used. The analysis revealed a complex spatial structure in the species assemblage caught and suggests that a single situation cannot describe the mixed fisheries of the Celtic Sea, but rather that there are several distinct cases of mixed fisheries. Our results also highlight the limitations of using the current level of data aggregation commonly requested in international data calls to model these fisheries and suggest that improvements should be made to ensure efficient evaluation of management options. Analyses of spatially resolved fisheries data such as the one presented here open a range of potential applications. In the context of the Common Fisheries Policy reform and the landing obligation, comparison of our results with applications of the same methodology to a subset of vulnerable species or to catches of fish below the minimum conservation reference size would help to identify the geographical areas to avoid and assess potential effort reallocation strategies based on groups of target species.},

abstract = {Achieving single species maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (mixed fisheries) is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. The North Sea mixed fisheries are a representative example of an issue that is generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of “pretty good yield”, implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range, minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks captured within mixed fisheries, and addressing explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks.},

FLR: an open-source framework for the evaluation and development of management strategies. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 640-646. The FLR framework (Fisheries Library for R) is a development effort directed towards the evaluation of fisheries management strategies. The overall goal is to develop a common framework to facilitate collaboration within and across disciplines (e.g. biological, ecological, statistical, mathematical, economic, and social) and, in particular, to ensure that new modelling methods and software are more easily validated and evaluated, as well as becoming widely available once developed. Specifically, the framework details how to implement and link a variety of fishery, biological, and economic software packages so that alternative management strategies and procedures can be evaluated for their robustness to uncertainty before implementation. The design of the framework, including the adoption of object-orientated programming, its feasibility to be extended to new processes, and its application to new management approaches (e.g. ecosystem affects of fishing), is discussed. The importance of open source for promoting transparency and allowing technology transfer between disciplines and researchers is stressed.},

abstract = {Alternative management scenarios were evaluated in a simulation framework that mimicked the recent exploitation of sole and plaice in the North Sea. A large proportion of plaice is taken as bycatch of the beam trawl fleet targeting sole, yet current management of the two stocks assumes no interaction in their exploitation. The evaluation criteria included biological and economic sustainability, and stability in the management measures. The fishery was assumed to respond to management restrictions by dropping the least profitable trips. We investigated two contrasting management strategies, single-species total allowable catches, and effort regulation. Under the assumptions made, the latter strategy performed better. The results suggest that, given assessment error and bias, a strategy that accounts for the mixed nature of a fishery and that occasionally results in perceived underexploitation may work best. Stability in fishing mortality reinforces itself, through lower assessment bias, and management corrections become less frequent. The common assumption in many stock assessments in EC waters that fishing mortality in the most recent year should resemble the value obtained in previous years ("shrinkage") had a negative effect on the stability of control measures. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Temporary marine area closures or more permanent Marine Protected Areas are being proposed as potential options in ecosystem-based marine spatial management. These policy options are known to displace fishing effort. In this paper, EU Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data is combined with other site and vessel information and used to model the fishing site choice decision of Irish demersal otter trawlers. Uniquely, the fishing ground options used in the analysis reflect the actual seabed contours trawled by the fleet. The fishing site choice model, based on this natural site definition is compared to an alternative destination choice model where the fleet decision is specified using a grid based site definition as employed in previous work. It is argued that the natural site specification is a more realistic specification of the fisher site choice decision. Using the preferred natural fishing site choice model, a policy scenario involving the hypothetical closure of one of the fishing ground options is then simulated to examine the possible redistribution of fishing effort.},

abstract = {As a contribution to the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, we estimated the effects of spawning closures on stock status, ecosystem impacts and economic performance. We focused on the flatfish fishery in the North Sea and explored how spawning closures for plaice and sole contribute to sustainable management of 4 target species (sole, plaice, turbot and brill). Seasonal patterns in fishing effort and catchability by age group and area were estimated to quantify the effect of different spawning closure scenarios on the selection pattern. The scenario performance was evaluated using indicators of stock status (spawning stock biomass), economic performance of the fishery (yield, revenue) and ecosystem impact (discards, bycatch of cod and rays, seabed integrity, fisheries-induced evolution). In a single-species context, spawning closures may be beneficial for the target species, while in a mixed fisheries and ecosystem context, negative effects may occur. A spawning closure for plaice combines positive effects on the plaice stock and the revenue with reductions of the negative impact for several ecosystem indicators and only a small negative effect on sea bed integrity. The effects did not differ when evaluated at current levels of effort or at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) effort. Tailor-made solutions are required that need to be developed in stakeholder consultation to trade-off the ecological and economic objectives. Mixed-species MSY was lower than the sum of the single-species MSYs.},

abstract = {In the domain of decision-support tools for the management of marine fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time. In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental, institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature, focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics. We find that although economic factors are usually included as a dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social and social-psychological factors play a significant role in explaining observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be achieved via the development of multidisciplinary research programmes focusing on applied quantitative analysis of the drivers of fishing fleet dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Venables2009,
abstract = {We describe simple and effective methods for simulating the movement of a fishing fleet, the spatio-temporal allocation of effort, in the context of harvest policy evaluation. Vessel movements are simulated in a manner that can balance established seasonal fishing patterns with the influence of perceived local variations in abundance. In the longer term, the model adapts smoothly to changes in fleet size and price fluctuations in critical resources, such as fuel. Given an initial allocation of effort at a fine temporal (but coarse spatial) scale, as needed for projecting stock dynamics, a second phase assigns the effort at a finer spatial (but coarser temporal) scale for environmental impact assessment. The first phase is based on a discrete-state, time-inhomogeneous Markov chain, with transition probabilities following a multiple logistic model. Although the ideas are generic, the method has been developed for the specific case of Australia's northern prawn fishery, which is used to motivate and describe the method. The approach, in a harvest policy evaluation context, is novel in that it uses economic projections (not surrogates) to reflect realistically the recent pressures many fishing industries are under to change their spatial fishing pattern in response to global fuel price fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {This study presents a fleet-based bioeconomic simulation model to the international mixed flatfish fishery in the North Sea. The model uses a Management Strategies Evaluation framework including a discrete choice model accounting for short-term temporal changes in effort allocation across fisheries. A simplified random utility model was used based on the expected revenue (or economic attractiveness) and two tradition parameters related to short and long term historical fishing patterns. All three parameters were significant. Even though reactions and adaptations vary between fleets, the estimated conservative behaviour of the main fleets led to only marginal effect at the stock level. The importance of accounting for fleet behaviour was then evaluated using an elasticity analysis to explore how increased weight of economic attractiveness contributes to changes in the biological output and positive increase in the economic performance of the individual fleets. This showed the existence of a window of sensitivity of the model to the behaviour assumptions. The study highlights the challenge of implementing an effort allocation model in a general framework of Management Strategies Evaluation for mixed-fisheries, and illustrates the necessary trade-offs between very detailed numerical relationships and the representation of aggregated processes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fisheries management is moving towards ecosystem based management instead of traditional single species based advice. To progress towards an ecosystem approach, a new methodology called "Fleet and Fisheries Forecast" (Fcube) has been proposed. In the application of the method, a precise initial fleet and metier segmentation used is important to get representative results in the analysis. Once they were defined, different data aggregations for fleets and metiers were tested with the objective of getting the best aggregation level to get equilibrium between detailed results and real management. Results showed that the difference in the forecast catches in different aggregation levels was low. Finally, hindcasting analyses were carried out to evaluate how sensitive forecasts are to different parameters. Stock indicators and catchability show the highest source of error and the effort share the lowest. In this analysis, Western Waters fleet management results show consistency between stocks and their respective TACs. The study highlights that it is possible to deliver advice within the context of mixed fisheries using the Fcube method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},
