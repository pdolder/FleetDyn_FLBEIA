\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Important for MSEs to take account of mixed fisheries
		interactions
	\item As part of that, need to understand how fleet behaviour might
		effect catch
	\item FLBEIA extension to include commonly used fleet dynamics models	

\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}
\label{meth}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement fleet dynamics models in FLBEIA
	\item Fit models
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Gravity
			\item Gravity + tradition
			\item Markov
			\item RUM
		\end{itemize}
	\item Condition seasonal FLBEIA model
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 4 seasons
			\item Metiers defined by spatial patterns in catch
			\item Implement fleet dynamics model for Irish otter
				trawlers
		\end{itemize}
	\item Simulations including closures
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Close a metier, how does effect reallocate
		\end{itemize}
	\item MSE with different fleet dynamics models as OM
\end{itemize}
